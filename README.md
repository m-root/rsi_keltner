I need to create an automatic trading program using python that will run stand alone on windows based computer. The program must be able to connect with the Bybit exchange and place trades for BTC and ETH. The program must execute trades based on RSI indicator that matches Tradingview's RSI. Tradingviews RSI is slightly different from standard RSI and you must be able to develop the correct RSI so entry signals operate very similar to Tradingview. The program will have multiple variables that I will need the ability to change if needed.
Must have prior experience creating standalone crypto trading programs in python.
I have a defined set of rules for entry and profit taking at multiple points documented on several pages to help you develop program. I will also provide pictures of Tradingview chart showing my trading process so you will have a clear understanding of what I need. I will need instructions for setting up the program on my PC also.
My Bybit account must remain secure, I cannot provide you access to my account. Please set up your own if needed. Testing can be done using Bitmex data because pricing and entry is almost exactly like Bybit.
I will be interested in eventually connecting this program to other crypto exchanges but I must start with Bybit exchange first.
You must be able to understand English, to avoid miscommunication
Cost is important to me and will be a factor in who I choose.
If you are interested, please let me know your thoughts or questions.
